# __Astro Weight Calculator__

This nifty calculator will show you all the weighs to prepare yourself for traversing the outer space! Want to plan for your trip to Pluto? Find out how much you weigh before you pack up for the last adventure of your lifetime by typing in your weight (on Earth of course)! Or maybe you're one of those heartless people who don't think Pluto is a planet anymore-- that's alright too! Simply select the "Hide Pluto" option before you ever have to see that pesky planet again.
